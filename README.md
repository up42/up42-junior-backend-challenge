# 🧪 Backend Pair Programming Challenge

Welcome to the backend pair programming challenge! In this session, you’ll collaborate live with one of our engineers to solve a practical backend task.

The goal isn’t to get everything perfect — it’s to see how you approach problems, communicate your thinking, and write working code together.

---

## 🚀 How It Works

- We’ll be working **together** on this project **live during the interview**.
- You can choose the programming language you’re most comfortable with:
    - `kotlin/`
    - `java/`
    - `python/`
- You’re free to use **any tools you’d normally use in real life**:
    - Your favorite IDE
    - Google or documentation
    - AI assistants (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, etc.)
    - Any libraries or utilities that help

If you’re unsure about something during the interview — **ask!**  
Questions are encouraged and expected. That’s how good collaboration works.

> ℹ️ **Note:** The code you’ll see isn’t perfect — and that’s on purpose.  
> Some parts are messy or incomplete to spark discussion and give us a chance to think through improvements together.

## 🧰 Required Preparation

Please make sure the project runs smoothly on your machine **before** the interview so we don’t spend time on setup.

### ✅ General Setup

- Clone the repo and open it in your IDE.
- Let your IDE finish indexing and downloading dependencies.
- Make sure the code runs and tests pass locally.

### 🧑‍💻 Language-Specific Setup

#### Kotlin

- **Requirements**: Java 17+
- **Run the app**:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew bootRun
  ```
- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew test
  ```

#### Java

- **TODO**: Add instructions for building, running, and testing the Java version.

#### Python

- **Requirements**: Python 3.10+ and Poetry
- **Install dependencies**:
  ```bash
  poetry install
  ```
- **Run the app**:
  ```bash
  poetry run uvicorn src.main:app --reload
  ```
- **Run tests**:
  ```bash
  poetry run pytest
  ```

## 💡 Bonus Tip

Before the interview, take a few minutes to:

- Skim through the code in your preferred language folder
- Understand the structure and what it already does

This can give you a helpful head start when we jump into coding.
